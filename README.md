üíª Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Cheat Sheet

üóÇÔ∏è 1. Core Cloud Concepts (20-25%)

**    Cloud Models:**

        Public Cloud: Resources are owned and operated by a third-party cloud provider.

        Private Cloud: Owned and maintained by an organization for internal use.

        Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared.

**    Benefits of Cloud Computing:**

        Cost Savings: Pay-as-you-go (OPEX) instead of capital expenditures (CAPEX).

        High Availability: Redundant data centers ensure uptime.

        Scalability: Vertical (scale up) and horizontal (scale out).

        Elasticity: Automatic scaling based on demand.

        Agility: Fast deployment and updates.

        Disaster Recovery: Built-in recovery options.

**    Service Models:**

        IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Virtual machines, networking, and storage (e.g., Azure VMs).

        PaaS (Platform as a Service): Platform for building and deploying applications (e.g., Azure App Service).

        SaaS (Software as a Service): Software delivery over the internet (e.g., Microsoft 365).

üîó 2. Core Azure Services (15-20%)

    Compute:

        Azure Virtual Machines (VMs): On-demand computing power.

        Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Managed Kubernetes for containerized applications.

        App Services: Hosting web apps and APIs.

        Azure Functions: Event-driven, serverless computing.

    Networking:

        Virtual Networks (VNets): Isolated networks within Azure.

        Azure DNS: Domain name resolution.

        Load Balancer: Distributes incoming network traffic.

        VPN Gateway: Secure cross-premises connectivity.

    Storage:

        Blob Storage: Unstructured data storage.

        Disk Storage: Managed disks for VMs.

        File Storage: SMB and NFS file shares.

        Azure SQL Database: Managed SQL database service.

    Database Services:

        Azure Cosmos DB: Globally distributed NoSQL database.

        Azure SQL Database: Managed relational database.

**üîí 3. Security, Privacy, Compliance, and Trust (25-30%)**

    Azure Identity Services:

        Azure Active Directory (AAD): Identity and access management.

        Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds a second verification layer.

        Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Fine-grained access management.

    Security Tools and Features:

        Azure Security Center: Unified security management.

        Azure Sentinel: Cloud-native SIEM solution.

        Azure Key Vault: Securely manage keys and secrets.

        Azure Firewall: Network security to protect Azure resources.

    Privacy and Compliance:

        Trust Center: Details on compliance certifications.

        Service Trust Portal: Information on how Microsoft implements security.

**üí≤ 4. Azure Pricing and Support (20-25%)**

    Pricing Models:

        Consumption-Based (Pay-As-You-Go): Pay only for what you use.

        Reserved Instances: Commit to a VM for 1-3 years to save costs.

        Spot Pricing: Utilize unused capacity at lower prices.

    Cost Management:

        Azure Cost Management + Billing: Monitor and control spending.

        Pricing Calculator: Estimate costs.

        Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator: Compare on-prem vs. Azure.

    Support Plans:

        Basic: Free; billing and subscription support.

        Developer: Non-production environments.

        Standard: Production workloads.

        Professional Direct: Business-critical workloads.

        Premier: Comprehensive support.

**üåê 5. Governance and Monitoring (10-15%)**

    Azure Policy: Define rules and enforce compliance.

    Azure Blueprints: Automate and deploy compliant environments.

    Azure Monitor: Monitor application performance.

    Azure Service Health: Track health of Azure services.

    Log Analytics: Collect and analyze logs.

**üß† Exam Tips:**

    Understand Cloud Concepts: Be able to differentiate between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.

    Know Key Services: Focus on core Azure services and their use cases.

    Security and Compliance: Understand how Azure secures data and manages identities.

    Pricing Models: Know how cost management tools work and the different pricing tiers.
